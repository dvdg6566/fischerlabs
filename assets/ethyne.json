A too fast withdrawal may carry over solvent, leaving gaseous acetylene at high pressure or may cause static electricity sparks.

It reacts with silver, copper and lead to form sensitive, explosive salts. Since acetylene is endothermic and effectively a reducing agent, its reaction with oxidants can be very violent (examples: calcium hypochlorite, nitric acid, nitrogen oxide, ozone, trifluoromethyl hypofluorite, etc.). Contact of very cold liquefied gas with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization, due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980]. Acetylene and ammonia can form explosive silver salts in contact with Ag.

While setting up an AAS instrument for use with nitrous oxide-acetylene, an explosion occurred shortly after switching from compressed air to the oxide, when the flame became unstable. This was attributed to the outdoor location of the nitrous oxide cylinder (at 5 \u00b0C) and the expansion cooling (4 \u00b0C) occurring in the reducing valve, combining to reduce the oxide flow to the point of flame instability and flashback. It was proposed that in student laboratories, air-acetylene flame sources should be replaced by air-natural gas flames to improve safety aspects with very little fall-off in detection limits in instrumental AA metal determinations. Three further incidents involving explosions in AAS installations are reported, one involved accidental contamination of the acetylene inlet line by liquid acetone from an overfilled acetylene cylinder. The other explosions involved leakage of acetylene gas inside the instrument cases and ignition by the electrical controls. Fitting of acetylene sensors inside such instruments to prevent further incidents is suggested. Acetylene gas leaking from a supply tube was ignited by the source flame and a minor explosion occurred, and appears to have damaged both gas supply lines, which led to a second major explosion and fire.

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) issues this Safety Bulletin to focus attention on flammable gas hazards. It recommends specific actions that companies generating acetylene, and others, should take to prevent similar incidents, which include: Maintain up-to-date operating procedures and checklists for the entire operating process. Train staff on the operating procedures and require them to demonstrate their ability to correctly follow them. Relocate drains and vents connected to flammable gas-containing equipment to safe, preferably outside, locations. Ensure that buildings and enclosures that could potentially contain acetylene meet the requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 51A. Inspect, test, and maintain check valves and block valves.

Acetylene is released from burning wood. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.65X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase acetylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 days. Acetylene has a calculated global lifetimes ranging from 14 to 32 days in the atmosphere. Acetylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acetylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Acetylene will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, acetylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hours and 2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to acetylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to acetylene via inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, use of acetylene torches during welding, soldering and other metal work and through inhalation of cigarette and wood smoke.
