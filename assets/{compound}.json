It was found that fine particulate matter (PM) levels exceeded the federal daily 24-hr average standard during the fire. There was a slight increase in some of the gaseous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, which exceeded federal standards. Ozone (O3) precursors, such as total hydrocarbons and methane gases, experienced elevated concentration during the fire.  Fortunately, the absence of sunlight because of the cloud of thick smoke that covered most of the county during the fire appears to have prevented the photochemical conversion of the precursor gases to harmful concentrations of O3.  Statistical analysis of the compiled medical surveillance data has been used to establish correlations between pollutant levels in the region and the resultant health problems experienced by the county citizens.

Based on these values, the inhibitory potency of the hydrocarbon gases increased in the order methane << ethane < propane < i-butane < n-butane.

It is released to the environment as natural emissions from microbes, animal waste, and volcanos. Other important sources of methane is the rumen of domestic animals (especially cattle) and emissions during the growing of rice. Methane is stored as methane hydrates in immense amounts both in Arctic regions and in marine sediments. The worldwide amounts of methane hydrates are conservatively estimated to total twice the amount of carbon found in all known fossil fuels on earth. Methane may be released as a fugitive emission from hydrofracking gas processing equipment. The compound's production and use in synthesis gas production, in manufacture of hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, acetylene, formaldehyde, and in organic syntheses may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Its use as a constituent of illuminating and cooking gas will result in its direct release to the environment. Direct release of methane to the environment will also occur due to hydrocarbon venting and water discharges from offshore production operations, two major sources of methane. Methane gas is a major product in sludge digestion with sludge gas consisting of 65-70% methane. Methane may be released to the environment as emissions from coal outgassing, combustion and liquefaction, and as emissions from waste incineration. Methane may be released to the environment as emissions from automobile, turbine and diesel exhaust. Methane may be released to the environment as emissions from biomass and polymer combustion, foundries, sewage and water treatment, veneer drying and wood pulping, and landfills. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.66X10+5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase methane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 yrs. Methane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.66 atm-cu m/mole. Methane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. An average utilization of 55% for methane by anaerobic soil microorganisms suggests that biodegradation may be an environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, methane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation half-lives were estimated to range from 70 days to infinity using anaerobic model estuarine ecosystems, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to methane may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where methane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methane via inhalation of ambient air.

Since CH(4) has a relatively short lifetime and it is very close to a steady state, reductions in its emissions would quickly benefit climate. Sensible emission mitigation strategies require quantitative understanding of CH(4)'s budget of emissions and sinks. Atmospheric observations of CH(4) abundance and its rate of increase, combined with an estimate of the CH(4) lifetime, constrain total global CH(4) emissions to between 500 and 600 Tg CH(4) yr(-1). While total global emissions are constrained reasonably well, estimates of emissions by source sector vary by up to a factor of 2. Current observation networks are suitable to constrain emissions at large scales (e.g. global) but not at the regional to national scales necessary to verify emission reductions under emissions trading schemes. Improved constraints on the global CH(4) budget and its break down of emissions by source sector and country will come from an enhanced observation network for CH(4) abundance and its isotopic composition (delta(13)C, deltaD(D=(2)H) and delta(14)C). Isotopic measurements are a valuable tool in distinguishing among various sources that contribute emissions to an air parcel, once fractionation by loss processes is accounted for. Isotopic measurements are especially useful at regional scales where signals are larger. Reducing emissions from many anthropogenic source sectors is cost-effective, but these gains may be cancelled, in part, by increasing emissions related to economic development in many parts of the world.

The growth rate of atmospheric methane is determined by the balance between surface emissions and photochemical destruction by the hydroxyl radical, the major atmospheric oxidant. Remarkably, this growth rate has decreased markedly since the early 1990s, and the level of methane has remained relatively constant since 1999, leading to a downward revision of its projected influence on global temperatures. Large fluctuations in the growth rate of atmospheric methane are also observed from one year to the next, but their causes remain uncertain. Here we quantify the processes that controlled variations in methane emissions between 1984 and 2003 using an inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry. Our results indicate that wetland emissions dominated the inter-annual variability of methane sources, whereas fire emissions played a smaller role, except during the 1997-1998 El Nino event. These top-down estimates of changes in wetland and fire emissions are in good agreement with independent estimates based on remote sensing information and biogeochemical models. On longer timescales, our results show that the decrease in atmospheric methane growth during the 1990s was caused by a decline in anthropogenic emissions. Since 1999, however, they indicate that anthropogenic emissions of methane have risen again.

For example, a late-autumn shoulder is consistently observed in the seasonal cycles of atmospheric methane at high-latitude sites, but the sources responsible for these increased methane concentrations remain uncertain. Here we report a data set that extends hourly methane flux measurements from a high Arctic setting into the late autumn and early winter, during the onset of soil freezing. We find that emissions fall to a low steady level after the growing season but then increase significantly during the freeze-in period. The integral of emissions during the freeze-in period is approximately equal to the amount of methane emitted during the entire summer season. Three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry and transport model simulations of global atmospheric methane concentrations indicate that the observed early winter emission burst improves the agreement between the simulated seasonal cycle and atmospheric data from latitudes north of 60 degrees N.
